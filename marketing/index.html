      <p>Do you think you may have trouble with your drinking? Wondering, “Do I have a problem with alcohol?” Do you want to stop drinking? If you are asking, “How do I stop drinking?” “How do I control my drinking?” “I think I want to stop but then I start drinking again.” 
        “Why do I keep drinking?” “Where is AA near me?” and you have never been to AA before, give us a call – someone will be glad to talk to you and help you find an AA meeting. Are you wondering: What is AA? How do I find AA? Where is AA near me? 
        <strong>IF YOU ARE NEW TO AA PLEASE REACH OUT. PHONE LINES ARE OPEN.</strong> Both virtual and in-person meetings exist.</p>

        <p><strong>THANKSGIVING HOLIDAYS:</strong>Great news – AA still has meetings. Although our little local service center at 2926 Zuni will be closed Thursday & Friday November 24, & 25, 2022. AA meetings are still happening & phone lines are still open.</p>

        <h2>What is AA?</h2>

        <p><strong>A.A. PREAMBLE</strong>© Alcoholics Anonymous is a fellowship of people who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from alcoholism. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues or fees for A.A. membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions. A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes. Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
