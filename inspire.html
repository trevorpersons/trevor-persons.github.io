        		What makes a role model? A role model is someone that we look up to. Role models embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.
    		</p>
    		<p>
        		Lebron James has many of the qualities that embody a role model to me.
    		</p>
    		<ul>
        		<li>Outrageously hardworking - relentlessly works for a cause in the world</li>
        		<li>Motivates others - people follow a great leader</li>
        		<li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
        		<li>Commitment and drive - continues to commit and power through challenges</li>
        		<li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    		</ul>
    		<p>
        		Lebron James may not be the most important figure in the global aspect of things but he is important to me. This really is because he inspires me to get to work and commit myself to things that are important to me. Being one of the top 2 greatest players to ever lace up in the NBA, he uses his platform to promote positivity and to squash injustice that he sees in the world. I feel like he should be a role model for all people regardless of his basketball prowess. He is usually never in the media for negative things and is constantly a symbol of hardwork, talent and determination to his craft.
